# Between Branches

When comparing the differences between two branches, such as a feature branch and its upstream parent branch, use `git diff <branch1>..<branch2>`. This command displays the changes made on the feature branch relative to the parent branch. It's useful for reviewing the impact of new features or changes before merging them into your mainline.
