# What and Why?

Git hooks are customizable scripts that Git executes automatically before or after specific events, such as committing, pushing, or merging. These hooks allow developers to automate tasks, enforce coding standards, run tests, or perform other actions at crucial points in the Git workflow. By leveraging git hooks, teams can enhance their development process, maintain code quality, and ensure consistency across projects. Hooks can be implemented locally or shared among team members, providing a powerful mechanism for streamlining workflows and enforcing best practices throughout the development lifecycle.
