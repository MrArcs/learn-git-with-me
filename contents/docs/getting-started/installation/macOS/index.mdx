### On macOS

#### Using Homebrew
    ```sh
    brew install git
    ```
    If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    ```

#### Using MacPorts
    ```sh
    sudo port install git
    ```
    If you don't have MacPorts installed, you can install it by running:

    ```sh
    sudo port selfupdate
    ```

#### Using Xcode Command Line Tools
    ```sh
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    This command will open a dialog box to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions to install the tools.

### Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify the installation by running:

```sh
git --version
```

Or

```sh
git -v
```
