#### Using Git for Windows
    - Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    - Run the installer and follow the instructions


#### Using Chocolatey
    ```sh
    choco install git
    ```
    If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by running:
    ```sh
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```

#### Using Scoop
    ```sh
    scoop install git
    ```
    If you don't have Scoop installed, you can install it by running:

    ```sh
    iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')

    ```
#### Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify the installation by running:

    ```sh
    git --version
    ```
Or
    
    ```sh
    git -v
    ```
If Git is installed, it should show something like `git version X.Y`.
