# Git Adding New Files

You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.

So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you just created.


For this example, I am going to use a simple HTML file like this:

### Example
```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Git File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, Git!</h1>
    <p>This is my first file in my new Git repository.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this file as `index.html` in the folder you created earlier.

Now, let's add this file to the Git repository.

### Steps to Add a New File to Git

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where your Git repository is located.
```bash
cd Newproject
```
cd path/to/your/folder

3. Use the following command to add the new file to the staging area:

```bash
git add index.html
```
Then we check the Git status and see if it is a part of our repo:
    
```bash 
git status
```
